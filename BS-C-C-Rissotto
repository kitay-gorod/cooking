# Butternut Squash, Chicken and Chestnut Rissotto 

## Ingredients

* 1 medium butternut squash
* 1 large red onion (or two small ones)
* 200 g leftover cooked chicken
* 1 chopped onion
* 2 pints chicken stock
* 285 g risotto rice
* 60 g cubed butter
* 60 g grated parmesan
* 200 g vaccuum-packed chesnuts
* 2 tblsp olive oil
* 1 tblsp dried red chilli flakes
* 2 tblsp chopped fresh sage
* salt and pepper to taste

## Method

1. Peel and cube the butternut squash, removing its seeds as necessary.
2. Cut the red onion into wedges.
3. Combine butternut squash and red onion wedges, olive oil, chilli flakes and salt and pepper in roasting tin.
4. Cook for 40 minutes in total.
5. After butternut squash (etc.) has been cooking for 25 minutes, gently fry chopped onion in half of the butter until it is just about to colour. Use a wide-bottomed pan that has a lid (lid will be needed later).
6. Heat up chicken in chicken stock and leave simmering.
7. Once the onion is cooked, add rice and stir until coated in butter.
8. Add ladel full of stock to the onion and rice mixture. Stir and continue adding stock until stock is fully absorbed. This should take 18 minutes.
9. With last ladel-full of stock, add the chicken, halved chestnuts and chopped sage. When all stock is absorbed, add butternut squash from the oven.
10. Take off heat and add parmesan and butter onto the top of the risotto. Cover with lid and leave to rest for 3 minutes.
11. After 3 minutes, remove lid and stir in melted butter and parmesan.
12. Serve, adding extra parmesan if required.
